        Fire safety is an essential aspect of everyday life that cannot be overemphasized. Every year, numerous lives are lost, and properties worth millions of money are destroyed due to fires. Most of these tragedies can be avoided if adequate fire safety measures are taken. 

		Fire safety is essential because it can save lives and property. Fires are destructive and can spread rapidly, making them difficult to control. It is therefore important to take steps to prevent fires from occurring in the first place. For instance, installing smoke detectors in homes and offices can help alert occupants to the presence of smoke or fire, giving them enough time to evacuate the building before the fire spreads. Fire drills are also an effective way of preparing people for fire emergencies, allowing them to know the exit routes and muster points.</p></center>

			<td>Electrical fires are a significant cause of residential and commercial building fires, resulting in property damage, injuries, and even fatalities. Preventing electrical fires involves identifying potential hazards and taking steps to eliminate them. Here are some practical tips on how to prevent electrical fires</td>

<td>1. Regularly inspect electrical cords and outlets: Inspect electrical cords and outlets for any signs of wear and tear. If you notice frayed wires, cracked cords, or loose outlets, repair or replace them immediately.</td>

<td>2. Avoid overloading outlets: Overloading outlets with too many appliances or devices can cause overheating and electrical fires. Use surge protectors to avoid overloading and spread the electrical load across different outlets.</td>

<td>3. Be mindful of extension cords: Extension cords should only be used temporarily and should not be used as a permanent wiring solution. Avoid using extension cords near water or in damp areas, and never run them under rugs or furniture.</td>

<td>4. Use the right wattage bulbs: Use the appropriate wattage light bulbs for light fixtures, and do not exceed the maximum wattage indicated on the fixture. Using bulbs with a higher wattage can cause overheating and electrical fires.</td>

<td>5. Hire a professional electrician: Hire a licensed electrician to inspect and maintain your home's electrical systems, especially if you have an older home. A professional can identify potential hazards and recommend the necessary repairs and upgrades to ensure your electrical system is up to code.</td>

<td>6. Unplug appliances when not in use: Unplug appliances when not in use, and do not leave them running overnight or while you are away from home. Appliances left plugged in can overheat and start an electrical fire.</td>
